üöÄ Installation & Usage
Follow these steps to get the Band Name Generator up and running on your local machine:

Clone the Repository (or save the code):
If this were in a Git repository, you'd clone it. For now, simply save the provided Python code (from the band-name-generator-streamlit immersive) into a file named band_generator.py in a directory of your choice.

Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):
It's good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

python -m venv venv

Activate the Virtual Environment:

Windows:

.\venv\Scripts\activate

macOS/Linux:

source venv/bin/activate

Install Dependencies:
Install the necessary Python libraries using pip:

pip install streamlit google-generativeai

Set Up Google Gemini API Key:

Obtain a free API key from Google AI Studio.

Important: For local development, you can directly paste your API key into the GEMINI_API_KEY variable in band_generator.py. For deployment or more secure handling, consider using Streamlit's secrets management (e.g., st.secrets["gemini_api_key"]).

Run the Application:
Navigate to the directory where you saved band_generator.py in your terminal and run:

streamlit run band_generator.py

Your default web browser will automatically open to display the Band Name Generator app.
